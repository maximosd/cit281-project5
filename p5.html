    <p class="projectDescription">
        Project 5 allowed us to be creative and create a program of our choice. We were encouraged to use AI
        to build the client (HTML and CSS files). I decicded to creat a game called "LootBox Roulette".
        In this game, each player starts with 100 coins. They are then able to buy an item from a lootbox. 
        The items come in common, rare, and legendary. The player clicks the button called ‘Open Box’. 
        This will give them one item from either a common, rare, or legendary box. This is then displayed on 
        the screen. Once the player reaches less than 10 coins, they will no longer be able to purchase any 
        more boxes. The player inputs their name using the /:name part of the route. This tracks each player’s 
        inventory for each server session. Once the server is ended and restarted, each player’s inventory is 
        wiped. You could theoretically make as many players as your memory allowed per session. Copilot helped 
        me walk through linking up files together, and where it made sense to put different code blocks. ChatGPT 
        came up with the idea for the game and built the html file and CSS files. It also helped with the 
        conceptual aspect of game play.

        In Lab 6, we practiced getting more familiar with GitHub. We completed the Introduction to GitHub course on 
        GitHub Learning Lab. We then moved over to VS Code and completed a task involving creating a classfor a libary inventory. 
        We practiced adding new classes by running our functions.
